# General Info
I took [this](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud9012) course provided by Udacity in order to brush over my knowledge from previous semester at the university, but also to spread my horizon regarding mobile development in Kotlin. Throught this course I covered from basic Android components to know how to use technologies like Room, Retrofit, online and offline services, and, basically create an application that is suitable for every type of user.

# Conclusion
Going through this course was an incredible experience! Some concepts were new to me and some of them required brushing over since my previous semester at my university in which I first learned about mobile development. From the basic concepts of how to order your files and what are Android components, to constructing a holesome application with a secure architecture implementing a local database with Room, web service integration with Retrofit, various UI/UX elements with focus to all categories of users, this course takes you through all. The teachers are great and the leassons are structured very well. It all seems like a day on the playground, not even acknowledging how fast you accumulate new information. 🏆
<p> I am more than happy that I stumbled across this course while browsing for learning content because is everything I could ask for and I recommend it deeply. Even though I already provided a link to the course, I will leave another one <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud9012">here</a>, because it's a chance you can't miss. Happy coding! 😉 </p>
